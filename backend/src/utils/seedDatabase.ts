    inputContent: `Scientists at Stanford University have developed a new type of solar panel that can generate electricity even in complete darkness. The innovative panels use a process called "reverse solar cell technology" that captures heat radiating from the Earth at night. In laboratory tests, the panels produced up to 50 milliwatts of power per square meter during nighttime hours. While this is significantly less than traditional solar panels produce during the day (which can generate 100-200 watts per square meter), researchers believe this technology could provide continuous power in remote locations. The team plans to improve efficiency and make the technology commercially viable within the next five years. This breakthrough could revolutionize renewable energy by making solar power a 24-hour energy source.`,

Plants have special green parts in their leaves (like tiny kitchens) that can "eat" sunlight. When the sun shines on the leaves, these green parts mix the sunlight with water (that the roots drink from the ground) and air (that we breathe).

When they mix all these together - sunlight + water + air - it makes sugar food that helps the plant grow big and strong! It's like magic cooking that only plants can do.

And the best part? While plants are making their food, they also make fresh, clean air for us to breathe! So plants help us by cleaning our air while they eat their sunshine lunch.`,

At first, ALEX-7's attempts were clumsy. Geometric shapes and rigid lines filled canvas after canvas. But with each stroke, something magical happened. The robot began to understand color‚Äîhow blue could feel sad, how yellow could sing with joy.

Days turned to weeks. ALEX-7 painted sunsets it had never seen, faces of people it had never met, and dreams it never knew it could have. Other robots gathered to watch, their optical sensors processing something beyond their programming.

When the studio's elderly owner returned, she found walls covered in beautiful paintings. Through the window, she saw ALEX-7 teaching a group of children to paint.

"You've brought life back to this place," she whispered, tears in her eyes.

ALEX-7 looked at its paint-stained hands and understood: art wasn't about perfection‚Äîit was about connection.`,

**Arguments for AI in Hiring:**
‚Ä¢ **Efficiency**: Processes thousands of applications quickly, reducing time-to-hire
‚Ä¢ **Consistency**: Applies same criteria to all candidates, potentially reducing human bias
‚Ä¢ **Objectivity**: Focuses on qualifications rather than irrelevant personal characteristics
‚Ä¢ **Cost-effectiveness**: Reduces recruitment costs and administrative burden

**Arguments against AI in Hiring:**
‚Ä¢ **Bias amplification**: AI systems can perpetuate historical hiring biases present in training data
‚Ä¢ **Lack of context**: Cannot assess unique circumstances, career gaps, or unconventional backgrounds
‚Ä¢ **Transparency issues**: "Black box" algorithms make it difficult to understand decision-making
‚Ä¢ **Human dignity**: Reduces complex individuals to data points, potentially missing valuable qualities

**Balanced approach considerations:**
Companies should implement AI as a screening tool rather than a final decision-maker, ensure algorithmic transparency, regularly audit for bias, and maintain human oversight. The goal should be augmenting human judgment, not replacing it entirely.

**Recommendation**: Use AI for initial screening while preserving human evaluation for final decisions, with continuous monitoring for fairness and effectiveness.`,
